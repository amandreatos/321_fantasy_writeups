## Imma need Abouttreefitty vs. Let_Me_Cool_That_Down 



Across sports, we have witnessed impossible happen. The 2017 New England Patriots winning the superbowl after being down 27 in the 4th quarter. #15 Norfolk State beating #2 Missouri in the 2012 March Madness Tournament. The Baltimore Orioles sweeping the Dodgers in the 1966 World Series. And now, Anthony, becoming the points winner for week 9 321 2017 Fantasy Football. Apparently this week the team of Imma Need Abouttreefitty decided that this was national "bend Elijah over and forget the lube" week. AJ Green was ejected during the game for fighting with Jalen Ramsey. AJ was all like "Screw you guy" and Jalen was all like "I'm not your guy, buddy" and AJ was all like "I'm not your buddy, friend". In the end, Anthony came out the points winner for the week and when asked to comment on his performance he said "nice". 



**Let_Me_Cool_That_Down Wins: 128.6 vs. 82.8 **





## Bearly Fantasy vs. The Michael Scarns 



Although Carter is more than likely not keeping up with his team, he managed to outscore Jonathan, who has figured out how to utilize his bench properly. With Zach Ertz out, Mike Evans suspended, and Gostowski on bye, the combination of Kelce, Gurley, and Hyde got the job done. Cameron Brate looked like a giant steaming pile of poo on Sunday and Jordy Nelson acting like a stretched anal cavity. Although Bearly Fantasy put up a good fight, only losing by 5.1 points. We will see how the rest of the season turns out, as The Micheal Scarns have acquired a new owner. Bearly Fantasy was left with the most painful blue balls, as is tradition. 



**The Michael Scarns Win: 119 - 113.9 **

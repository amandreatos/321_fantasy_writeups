## The Michael Scarns vs. Imma need abouttreefitty 



The Michael Scarns came into week 8 confident that they could take down the powerhouse that is, Imma need abouttreefitty. Lesean McCoy came into Sunday with a full pair of nads, spraying ectoplasm all over The Michael Scarns. But of course, Jordan Reed was back to his usual self, just, just a big ol penis. Jameis Winston was vagtastic on Sunday only putting up 3.7 points, essentially a chode of a week. Imma need abouttreefitty did NOT give the Michael Scarns another dolla, and said "damn you Michael Scarns, get off my lawn!" 



**Imma need Abouttreefitty wins: 119.7 - 77.9 **



## Let_Me_Cool_That_Down vs Bearly Fantasy 



To the naked eye, it would look like Anthony had this week in the bag. But to the less scantily clad eye, it looked more like Anthony had some great performances from his team, but had clearly suffered from some intense brain farts and left Marshawn Lynch in his lineup. Ezekial tried his best to give Anthony that W for the week, but fell short with the lack of team management and was all like "ugh Anthony, you're breakin my bawls". Jonathan had another stellar performance from his team, granting him another point winner of the week, his second for the year. Team Bearly Fantasy didn't look scared going into this weeks matchup against Let_Me_Cool_That_Down, by saying quote "How do you not beat one which has no life?" 



**Bearly Fantasy wins: 128.2 - 119.7 **

## The Micheal Scarns vs. Bearly Fantasy

Coming off his first loss, Carter was looking to start his winning streak over again when he faced Jonathan. Kelvin Benjamin started the beginning of week 6 off with a bang, raking in 18.9 points on Thursday night. Carter must have felt ecstatic when A-A Ron got manhandled and said "screw you guys, I'm going home", bringing in only a measly 0.7 points for Bearly Fantasy. Well it was about that time Le'Veon and Fournette noticed the Micheal Scarns were about 7 stories tall and had players from the Paleolithic Era. Bearly Fantasy said, damn you Micheal Scarns, I ain't giving you no win this week. 

**Bearly Fantasy Wins: 131.4-110.8 **

## Let Me Cool That Down  vs. Imma Need Abouttreefitty

Elijah was coming in on a winning streak and Anthony was determined to cool that down for him. However, it is difficult to score point when you are either A. On a bye week or B. Suspended for 6 games. This proved to be a bit problematic for Anthony this week, as he left 2 crucial spots empty, longing to be filled. The Gronk gave Anthony hope with 26.3 points, and told Elijahs ass of a Tight End, Jordan Reed, "you just got served". But it was the Mecha Barbara Streisand, Antonio Brown that prevented the cooling of Imma Need Abouttreefitty. In the end, Anthony gave Elijah yet another damn tree fitty.

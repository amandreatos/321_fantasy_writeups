## About Tree Fitty vs. Team Higgie

This week was all about wide receivers, with A.J. Green pulling in 29.9 points for About Tree Fitty, and Stefon Diggs contributing 35.9 points for Team Higgie. Apparently team $3.50 wanted his bench to outscore his starting squad, because you know, that's the smartest way to play fantasy. Points are hard to come by when players don't play, which is the hard truth Team Higgie had to face in Week 2, having 3 spots left open yearning for some action. Grace has humbly this knowledge and has refactored her starting line up for next week, looking for an upset win against Yung Will.



About Tree Fitty Wins: 115.6 - 83.2



## Yung Will vs. Bearly Fantasy

Both teams come into week two with impressive opening week wins, looking to create some distance within the East division. Jonathan kept Fournette in his lineup, in hopes that the Jacksonville head coach would see his lineup and put Fournette in despite his injury. It was a bold strategy Cotton, but it did not play out for Bearly Fantasy. Both teams put up redonkulous points in week two, but it was 4 players on Bearly Fantasy that gave Yung Will a goos spanking. Cousins, Gurley, Thielen, and Gordon combined for a whopping 127.5 points. Yung Will tried to make the turn, but ended up showing that he was a true Howlie. Jonathan earned his Mahalo Rewards Card and sipped his Chi-Chi all the way to a W.



Bearly Fantasy Wins: 169.1 - 157.5



## Team Shamsian vs. Ankle Snatchers

Cyrus and Steve came into week two looking for their first win, so each team had something to prove to the league. Both teams put together their best starting lineup, and both teams should be looking to make some trades if they want to make a run for the canadian. You would think Ryan Fitzpatrick owned a pig farm because he went HAM. But for Team Shamsian, the Fitz duo fell short with a measly 5.8 points from Larry Fitzgerald who apparently forgot how to football. Cam Newton looked like his former self as he racked up 27.6 points and dapped up bro-tini Zach Ertz who contributed 20.4 points en route to an Ankle Snatchers victory.



Ankle Snatchers Win: 120.5 - 104.3



## Let_Me_Cool_That_Down vs. Team Kenney

Anthony is still convinced that if he continues to leave players in his starting lineup that aren't playing (or in his case refusing to play), he will defeat his opponents. This strategy is struggling to prove to be successful as Team Kenney made Let_Me_Cool_That_Down look like a mildly decent middle school football team. Hannah's team is looking scary as she put up an incredible 181.3 points which led to the most points in the league in week 2. I am now convinced Hannah honey-dicked us all during the draft, acting like she didn't know anything about Fantasy Football. She knew, SHE ALWAYS KNEW! Team Kenney rolls over Anthony, and propels herself to a strong 2-0 start.



Team Kenney Wins: 181.3 - 113.8

## Bearly Fantasy vs. Imma need abouttreefitty 



Bearly Fantasy was feeling themselves after a nice performance last week against the formidable Micheal Scarns. Bearly Fantasy has also felt pretty good after they reevaluated their fantasy strategy by actually playing the players that gave them the most points. They figured that their bench had won enough games for the season, it was about time for the starting group to win. Russell Wilson gave Bearly Fantasy some hope, but then was quickly dashed when Fournette said "screw you guys, im going home" and gave Bearly Fantasy a great big goose egg. Essentially, Jordan Reed and LeSean McCoy double teamed Bearly Fantasy and was all like "imma need abouttreefittyy wants smoosh smoosh" and took advantage of their innocence. 



**Imma Need Abouttreefitty wins: 150.8 - 123.6 **





## Let_Me_Cool_That_Down vs. The Micheal Scarns 



After a tough loss last week, Anthony learned the hard lesson that people who are suspended and or on bye, have a hard time producing points. So good thing Anthony looked at his lineup and took suspended Zeke Elliot out of his lineup. WRONG. The NFL was all like, "whateva, whateva I do what I want" and for no reason reinstated Elliot. To make matters worse, Zeke disregarded the lube and continued to plow the helpless Anthony with 41 points on his bench. Also, Lynch went and bitch slapped the referee during his game, thus adding to Anthonys fantasy week that some are calling "the golden shower" of fantasy weeks. Carter said I'm an independent fantasy owner who don't need no defense. This was a ballsy move, but proved to show just enough balls for the win. 



**The Micheal Scarns Win: 128 - 89.4 **

## Yung Will vs. About Tree Fitty

As we enter week 1, playoff hopes and the chance to hold the coveted Canadian are at an all time high. The newcomer, Yung Will, enters week 1 having had himself a pretty good draft. Known juggernauts Tyreek Hill & DeAndre Hopkins, provide the biggest threats to Wills opponents. But in week 1, Tyreek Hill was not only a juggernaut, but showed himself to be Mecha Barbra Streisand. Hill gave Will close to a third of his overall points, which made him feel like he was celebrating his bar-mitzvah all over again. About Tree Fitty came up a bit inconsistent in week 1, and looks to make some roster swaps before week 2. The trio of A. Brown, AJ Green, & JuJu put up respectable numbers, and Tom Brady didn't file for Social Security, so there's a plus. There's reason to believe collusion was afoot, between the Saints Defense and the Team of Yung Will. The Saints Defense will now be referred to as the "Scott" Defense.

**Yung Will Wins 159.5 - 110.7 (Also Wins Points Winner For Week 1)**

## Team Higgie vs. Bearly Fantasy

You know what our motto here at 321 is, make mistakes and make them fast. Well it looks like Grace took that motto and implemented it in her team dynamic. By leaving Carson Wentz in the QB slot for week 1, she took a big ol fat goose egg, which cost her 19.5 points if she had put in Andrew Luck. Those 19.5 points would have given Grace the W for the week, and Team Higgie would be looking at a 1-0 start as opposed to an 0-1 start. Melvin Gordon showed up for Bearly Fantasy saying "I'm gonna leave 27.6 points right about myah". Fournette decided he would rather hurt himself in the first half than stay in and watch Eli Manning do what he does best, suck ass.

**Bearly Fantasy Wins 135.3 - 111.6**

## Ankle Snatchers vs. LET ME COOL THAT DOWN

This was a rematch of the finals last year that everyone was dying to see. And by everyone, I mean nobody even noticed this is what happened, therefore no one actually cared. Surprisingly the Ravens D came through for Steve putting up 17 points. Which actually happened to be more points than half of his starting squad, NICE D STEVE. But Anthony was not about to let Steve cool him down, no sir. Anthony said, "I'm pulling a play out of last years playbook and playing Le'Veon Bell even though his bitch ass is sitting out due to a sandy Va Jay Jay". Luckily Gronk and Mike Evans wanted to be team players and put up a combination of 50 points. The reigning Fantasy Football Champ was indeed, COOLED DOWN.

**LET ME COOL THAT DOWN Wins 152.9 - 137.7**

## Team Shamsian vs Team Kenney

This was a matchup of the true redshirt rookies, Cyrus and Hannah. Although Hannah came out looking like she had something to prove, and did she ever. Alvin Kamara proved to be Team Kenneys Celine Dion as he put up an impressive 43.1 points. Team Kenney looks like a force to be reckoned with this year. When asked about how she thinks this FF season is going to turn out for her, she stated that "My heart will go on....to win the Canadian". This quote has struck immense fear in Fantasy Owners office wide. Julio Jones was Leonardo Dicaprio drowning in the freezing water, and the rest of Team Shamsian sat their happy asses on the door watching everyone else freeze to death. This matchup can be summed up in one statement "OMG they did NOT kill KENNEY"

**Team Kenney Wins 155.9 - 86**
